        <h2>Reasons</h2>
        <p>There are several reasons behind creating this platform. In todays digital world, people often struggle to find genuine and meaningful connections. Many platforms focus solely on entertainment or surface-level intaeraction, leaving a gap for those who seek personal growth and deeper conversations.
